# Project: Understanding the Determinants of Health

BU School of Public Health has access to clinician notes collected during routine medical visits at the Boston Medical Center. These notes are written free-text reports of visits capturing the clinicianâ€™s findings, observations, and diagnoses.
We need to predict a diagnosis of substance abuse, alcohol use and tobacco smoking from the data in the notes by using techniques such as NLP and machine learning methods.
